# Data
Separate names datasets analysis
Description
This notebook processes and analyzes a dataset containing name, ID, and related features for 100 individuals.
Tasks include data loading, feature engineering, summary statistics, and grouping operations like quartile binning and vowel detection for first names.

### Requirements
Python 3

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

### Install dependencies using the command:

text
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
Usage
Download the dataset file named contentseparatednames.csv and place it in the notebook directory.

Open project_task.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run each cell sequentially to load data, perform feature engineering, and visualize summary statistics.

### Typical operations:

Loads and cleans dataset.

Engineers features like name length, starts-with-vowel, and group quartile.

Summarizes distributions and correlations.

Visualizes results using plots.

### Output
Summary tables of names and IDs.

Grouped statistics for quartiles and vowel detection.

Visualization of main features.
